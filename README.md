ZNFS's Not a Facebook Scraper

## About
ZNFS will help you clean your Facebook account.
It ultimately helps you in that by enforcing some criteria on your list of following/followers and removes those who don't meet this criteria.

ZNFS is still in it's early alpha stage and is barely usable, pull requests/collabs are welcome.
